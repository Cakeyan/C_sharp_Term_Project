## TL; DR - Quick Start

This project is based on Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 and can run successfully on these two versions. You can modify the IPv4 address and port, which is `localhost:802` now, in the `App.config` file in `Server` and `Client` directory. To connect to the specified server, clients need to modify the IP address and port the same as the IPv4 address of server, and make sure the server is running. Enjoy it!
